            <h3>Terms and Conditions</h3>
            <h5>Payment Obligations, Renewals, and Cancellations</h5>
            <ul>
                <li align="justify"><i class="bi bi bi-arrow-right-square-fill"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp; Website Development Payment Obligations :- A down payment is required in order to begin development of your website.
                 This is usually 50% of the upfront design fee, unless an alternative contract or proposal specifies a different amount. The outstanding balance on your website is due after the project have
been approved and successfully delivered. Final payment is due regardless of whether all content for the pages has been sent by the client. This provision is
in place to encourage the client to get content submitted promptly so that their site can go live. It also ensures that Fejlesztő gets paid for performing their
duty under the proposal, despite tardy content from the client. After payment, Fejlesztő will still post outstanding content AT NO CHARGE for 3 months. In the
event an “under construction” page is posted due to missing content, PRIME will post ONE copy of any text/pictures on existing pages only, for up to 3
months after publish date. After the three months have expired, content posted to site will be billable at our current regular hourly rate. In the event that
design and navigation changes are requested after they have been specifically approved by the client, these changes will be billable at our current regular
hourly rate.</li>
<li align="justify"><i class="bi bi bi-arrow-right-square-fill"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Website Development Cancellation :- if site design and development work has already begun (such as creating a design concept), then the down payment is
non-refundable. Fejlesztő my elect at its sole discretion to offer a partial refund depending upon the circumstances.</li>
<li align="justify"><i class="bi bi bi-arrow-right-square-fill"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Stock Photography Payment Obligations :- Stock photography includes most photos and/or images not provided by the client. Stock photography purchased
on behalf of client for use in website development is billable at a minimum of Birr 270 per picture. This amount is separate from the amount quoted for
website design and development. Some pictures are more expensive than Birr 270, in which case we will solicit client approval and communicate the price
before purchasing.</li>
<li align="justify"><i class="bi bi bi-arrow-right-square-fill"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Website Maintenance :- There are no required maintenance fees other than domain registration and hosting. Most people do some work on their site every
year, for which we offer several plans. We can make certain parts of the site updatable by you by implementing a custom Content Management System, or
installing a blog. For work we do on the site after going live, we charge on an hourly basis. If you expect that maintenance will be a regular occurrence, you
can buy a prepaid maintenance contract that affords a discounted hourly rate. If need be, we can customize a maintenance plan for your particular needs,
but no plan is required.</li>
<li align="justify"><i class="bi bi bi-arrow-right-square-fill"></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Website Maintenance Payment Obligations :- Depending upon the nature of the website changes, prepayment may be required. Should the client be
invoiced after the changes are completed, the invoice is due upon receipt. If payment is not received within 30 days, the maintenance changes may be taken
down until payment is received. After 60 days, there may also be a Birr 1,000 reposting fee added to the outstanding maintenance invoice balance.</li>
               
            </ul>

            <ul>
            <li align="justify"><i class="bi bi bi-arrow-right-square-fill"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Homepage Design- Once the site design is approved by the client, usually via email consent, the design is considered ready for implementation. Should the
client wish to make changes to a design they have approved, those changes are billable at our standard hourly rate.</li>
<li align="justify"><i class="bi bi bi-arrow-right-square-fill"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Navigation- Once site outline/map is approved by the client, usually via email consent, the site navigation is considered ready for implementation. Combined
with the approved graphic design, this becomes the site structure. Once we build this structure per client approval, any subsequent changes are billable at
our standard hourly rate.</li>
<li align="justify"><i class="bi bi bi-arrow-right-square-fill"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Database Implementation- Entry of data for database applications is considered client's responsibility. Entry of data by PRIME is billable, unless otherwise
provided for in customer's contract.</li>
<li align="justify"><i class="bi bi bi-arrow-right-square-fill"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp; Email- We offer free domain-based email accounts to our clients as part of any hosting contract. If site is not hosted by Fejlesztő, we take no responsil

<li align="justify"><i class="bi bi bi-arrow-right-square-fill"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Training-— For websites with administrative control panels or content management systems, two (2) one-hour training sessions will be provided.</li>
<li align="justify"><i class="bi bi bi-arrow-right-square-fill"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;fechnical Support —We offer local and long-distance phone support, email and LIVE CHAT to our clients. We do not normally bill for technical support
depending on the source of the problem, its severity, and our time invested. If Fejlesztő is not the source of the problem, technical support may be billable.</li>
